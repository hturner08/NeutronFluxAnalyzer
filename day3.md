### NINT Quench Avoidance STrategy and Cooling Requirements
## Strategy
- NINT TF magnet will be constructed to be passively protected to survive a full-field, full-magnet quench
# Normal Zone in Steady State

If there is a normal zone forming after hte pulse, as long as 10 kW/m^3 can be taken out by coolant, we can avoid an avalanche
quench.
#Coolant line Failure

## Design
-26 turns
-4 KA
-Each HTS stack has about 120 tapes
